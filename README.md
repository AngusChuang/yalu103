incomplete iOS 10.3Betas jailbreak for 64 bit devices by qwertyoruiopz, marcograssi, and devapple (personal use)

## I am using Lucaâ€™s yalu code for my own use and will not release 10.2.x jailbreak of my own.

Please use the "Issues" tab for **code related** issues only. If you need support please search on [/r/jailbreak](https://reddit.com/r/jailbreak) before posting a question there.

## Supported Devices and iOS versions

| Device | Version | Other |
|---------|----------|---------|
| iPhone 7  | iOS 10.3Beta3 | KPP bypass |

### Planned Support:

In the near future, the jailbreak will support the following devices:

| Device | Version | Additions | 
|---------|----------|----------|
| iPhone 6 | 10.3b3 | jb |
| iPhone SE | 10.3b3 | jb |
| iPhone 5S | 10.3b3 | jb |

**Note, the iPhone 7 is the only supported device on 10.3b3**
If you are already on iOS 10.3b with an any other device, **stay there**. The actual exploit behind this still works, but the KPP bypass does not.

## Warnings

This jailbreak is a work in progress. Some things do not work, but most things do.

Do not install things that are untested.

**AppSync and other unsupported and untested software will probably throw your device into a bootloop or do other bad things.** Do not open an issue complaining that your device has been bootlooped because you installed other software. You have been warned.

## Installing

This will be coming very soon!

| Beta 1 | Coming Soon |


## Substrate

On the iPhone 7 & Plus models the mobile substrate has been disabled due to a KPP misuse of function in the code, please respect this and do NOT get any repos that re-enable this, doing so may cause malfunction to your device.
